# AutomatedReminders
> I was managing a project with a multifunctional team of 20 Engineers, Project Managers and subconsultants from different levels across 12 countries. Prior to joining the project, there was a problem where financial data was missing or inaccurate in the system, because there wasn't a solid procedure of chasing individuals for timesheets and invoices. 
> 
> To eliminate this issue, I initiated creating automated emails to send weekly and monthly reminders to senior engineers and subconsultants. To do this, I created and debugged backend Python scripts to send weekly automated timesheet reminders and monthly invoice reminders to a list of contacts (in a separate Excel file) working on the project. This ensured that all the finances were sent in a timely manner and they were updated correctly on the system.

## General Information
- The purpose of this backend application is to automate weekly timesheet reminders to the multifunctional teams to ensure we achieve 100% accuracy and timely financial records. 
- I undertook this task as part of my role as a Project Manager as a personal project to increase efficiency within the team. 
- The first version is the previous version of the file without the use of classes. Version 2 incorporates implementing modules to promote efficiency and to allow repetition without repeating code and following DRY.


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.9
- Python library (Pandas)


## Features
- The contact list can be updated with contact names and email addresses which is kept private in the gitignore file.


## Setup
To set up the local environment, clone the repository. 

Clone the repository using the command line using HTTPS
- Paste this command in the command line: $ git clone https://github.com/ElizabethA01/Hacker-news-scraping.git or clone in VS code. 
- Run the code in invoiceReminderv2.py or timesheetReminderv2.py


## Usage
- The contact list can be updated with contact names and email addresses which is kept private in the gitignore file.


## Project Status
Project is: _ongoing. I have been looking at unit testing and debugging the code to take into account every case scenario.


## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Being able to easily update the input information so the code can be used by different team members within the PM team. 


## My Thoughts
-I really enjoyed this project, because it was very practical and I was able to incorporate all the knowledge I gained through the Python courses. This also built my confidence in Python scripts and using the Panda module. 
- Additionally, it made a significant impact on the project, as it eliminated gaps in the financial data and it helped to show an accurate representation of the cost spending on the project. 


## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by initiative to recognise an opportunity to make the workload more efficient within the team and to eliminate gaps in the financial reports.
